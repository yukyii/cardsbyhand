## Handmade digital cards for loved ones ♡

Since I was a kid, one of my favourite things to do was to make cards for my loved ones. I'd hoard a bunch of scrap materials and cute stickers, and when a special day came around, I'd unleash them onto paper and spin them into messages filled with love. To me, crafting cards by hand has always been a wonderfully tactile, intuitive and serendipitous experience.

This website is my attempt at digitizing the handmade. Cobble together random materials, sprinkle some doodles around, and send a mouse-made card to your special someone!

Made with Google AI Studio, memories and human imagination.
